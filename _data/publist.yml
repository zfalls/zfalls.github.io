- title: "Antiviral Approaches against Influenza Virus" 
  image: 
  description: Preventing and controlling influenza virus infection remains a global public health challenge, as it causes seasonal epidemics to unexpected pandemics. These infections are responsible for high morbidity, mortality, and substantial economic impact. Vaccines are the prophylaxis mainstay in the fight against influenza. However, vaccination fails to confer complete protection due to inadequate vaccination coverages, vaccine shortages, and mismatches with circulating strains. Antivirals represent an important prophylactic and therapeutic measure to reduce influenza-associated morbidity and mortality, particularly in high-risk populations. Here, we review current FDA-approved influenza antivirals with their mechanisms of action, and different viral- and host-directed influenza antiviral approaches, including immunomodulatory interventions in clinical development. Furthermore, we also illustrate the potential utility of machine learning in developing next-generation antivirals against influenza.

- title: "Trends in Prescribing Opioids, Benzodiazepines, and Both Among Adults with Alcohol Use Disorder in New York State"

  description: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a highly prevalent public health problem that contributes to opioid- and benzodiazepine-related morbidity and mortality. Even though co-utilization of these substances is particularly harmful, data are sparse on opioid or benzodiazepine prescribing patterns among individuals with AUD. Among those with AUD, opioid prescribing decreased following NYS I-STOP program implementation. While both benzodiazepine and opioid/benzodiazepine co-prescribing rates remained high, a decreasing trend was evident after program implementation. Continuing high rates of opioid and benzodiazepine prescribing necessitate the development of innovative approaches to improve the quality of care.

- title: "Multiscale Analysis and Validation of Effective Drug Combinations Targeting Driver KRAS Mutations in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer"

  description: Pharmacogenomics is a rapidly growing field with the goal of providing personalized care to every patient. Previously, we developed the Computational Analysis of Novel Drug Opportunities (CANDO) platform for multiscale therapeutic discovery to screen optimal compounds for any indication/disease by performing analytics on their interactions using large protein libraries. We implemented a comprehensive precision medicine drug discovery pipeline within the CANDO platform to determine which drugs are most likely to be effective against mutant phenotypes of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) based on the supposition that drugs with similar interaction profiles (or signatures) will have similar behavior and therefore show synergistic effects. CANDO predicted that osimertinib, an EGFR inhibitor, is most likely to synergize with four KRAS inhibitors.Validation studies with cellular toxicity assays confirmed that osimertinib in combination with ARS-1620, a KRAS G12C inhibitor, and BAY-293, a pan-KRAS inhibitor, showed a synergistic effect on decreasing cellular proliferation by acting on mutant KRAS. Gene expression studies revealed that MAPK expression is strongly correlated with decreased cellular proliferation following treatment with KRAS inhibitor BAY-293, but not treatment with ARS-1620 or osimertinib. These results indicate that our precision medicine pipeline may be used to identify compounds capable of synergizing with inhibitors of KRAS G12C, and to assess their likelihood of becoming drugs by understanding their behavior at the proteomic/interactomic scales.

- title: "Optimal COVID-19 therapeutic candidate discovery using the CANDO platform"
  image: fphar-13-970494-g004.jpeg
  description: The worldwide outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in early 2020 caused numerous deaths and unprecedented measures to control its spread. We employed our Computational Analysis of Novel Drug Opportunities (CANDO) multiscale therapeutic discovery, repurposing, and design platform to identify small molecule inhibitors of the virus to treat its resulting indication, COVID-19. Initially, few experimental studies existed on SARS-CoV-2, so we optimized our drug candidate prediction pipelines using results from two independent high-throughput screens against prevalent human coronaviruses. Ranked lists of candidate drugs were generated using our open source cando.py software based on viral protein inhibition and proteomic interaction similarity. For the former viral protein inhibition pipeline, we computed interaction scores between all compounds in the corresponding candidate library and eighteen SARS-CoV proteins using an interaction scoring protocol with extensive parameter optimization which was then applied to the SARS-CoV-2 proteome for prediction. For the latter similarity based pipeline, we computed interaction scores between all compounds and human protein structures in our libraries then used a consensus scoring approach to identify candidates with highly similar proteomic interaction signatures to multiple known anti-coronavirus actives. We published our ranked candidate lists at the very beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, 51 of our 276 predictions have demonstrated anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in published clinical and experimental studies. These results illustrate the ability of our platform to rapidly respond to emergent pathogens and provide greater evidence that treating compounds in a multitarget context more accurately describes their behavior in biological systems.
