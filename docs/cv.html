    2012 &#8211; Present    &#8212; Advisor: Eva Zurek
                    Primary research topic involves the molecular modeling of homogeneous and heterogeneous polyolefin polymer-
                    ization catalyzed by single-site metallocene complexes.  Metallocenes need to be activated by a co-catalyst such as
                    methylaluminoxane (MAO) in order for polymerization to occur. The structure(s) of MAO have remained a mystery
                    despite several experimental and theoretical studies.  Computational methods are employed to explore the dynamic
                    equilibria of various plausible MAO oligomers and structural entities for this elusive, yet significant, co-catalyst.
                    We are continuing to study the interaction of MAO oligomers with MgCl2 support. Our secondary project involves
                    further development of, XtalOpt, an open source evolutionary algorithm for crystal structure prediction.
       2011 &#8211; 2012  Undergraduate Researcher at Canisius College
                      &#8212; Advisor: Jeremy Steinbacher
                    Research in the field of bio-organic material synthesis, specifically mesoporous silica nanoparticles. Qualitative and
                    quantitative analyses were employed for these products using thermogravimetric analysis, thin-layer chromatogra-
                    phy, nuclear magnetic resonance, and other methods. Employed techniques to synthesize functionalized polyhedral
                    oligomeric silsesquioxanes.
     Summer 2011  Undergraduate Researcher at University at Buffalo, State University of New York
                    Research Education for Undergraduates
                      &#8212; Advisor: Eva Zurek
                    Ten week program to allow for the experience of graduate level research as an undergraduate. Research focused on
                    testing a newly written random docking algorithm to screen a library of possible monomers used for molecularly
                    imprinted polymers/xerogels.
